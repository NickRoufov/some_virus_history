                Here I tell you about the history of computer viruses, here we go!
            </div>
            <div class="virus1">
                The first ever virus was the "Creeper" and no, not the green and explosive one from Minecraft. It was created back in 1971 by Bob Thomas of BBN. It was more of a security test and had no malicious intent. Instead of causing havoc in the infected machine it just said:<br>"I AM THE CREEPER, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!", after that it would just delete itself from the machine and spread.
            </div>
            <div class="funfact">
                Fun fact: After the "CREEPER" was made a first ever antivirus software was born, it was named "REAPER", made by Ray Tomlinson in 1972. It's only mission was to stop the "CREEPER" from spreading.
            </div>
            <div class="virus2">
                However, about 3 years later after the "CREEPER" was made, another virus appeared and this time it was a malicious one. <br>
                The "RABBIT VIRUS" was created in 1974. It replicated itself rapidly in the computer which severely reduced system performance, in the end the computer just crashed

                You want to know the most dangerous computer virus known to mankind? Well, meet MYDOOM.
            </div>
            <div class="DOOM">
                A worm that made 38 billion dollars worth of damage. Impressive, right? It infected computers through email, creating backdoors. It commited DDoS attack on Microsoft and SCO group. It's rampage started somewhere in January, 2004.
